I found it pretty helpful to simply think of Turing Machines as functions in the programming world. They take an input, do some calculations, and return an output. The only difference is that unlike in the real world, your function has now unlimited memory space and time to compute the output.

Don't algorithms take an input, so some calculations, and return an output?

> Yeah?

So aren't all algorithms just functions?

Take your time. This is true for entire programs as well. After all, they're all just a collection of functions, which means you could construct a huge function containing everything inside of it. The same thing goes for your computer. So your program, application, computer, or whatever you want to call it, is just a function. 

> It's all just... a function?

Always has been.

> And if Turing Machines are just functions with endless memory...

Everything is just a Turing Machine with limited memory. [That's what we presume, at least.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis)

> Whoaa.

Then you can start connecting the dots. 

> What if the entire world is just a big function?

That's not what I meant.
